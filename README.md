# Comparison 
Svelte features no virtual DOM which React does to update its UI. Svelte instead utilizesd a JS compiler, this in theory leads to better performance for Svelte. React features JSX syntax which combines HTML and Javascript whereas Svelte uses a combines syntax of HTMl, CSS and Javascript. For this project we decided to use Tailwind for the overall styling of the website. 

Svelte is the overall more lightweight and simpler framework to use in a small project like this, and is therefore the framework we chose for our project. React in contrast is more powerful and therefore more popular in the real world among programmers.
